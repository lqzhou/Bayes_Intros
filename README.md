# Bayes_Intros

Some tutorial material on Bayesian stats and modelling from past workshops.

'Bayes_Stats_Intro' focuses on statistics, particularly on sampling and Bayes vs. null hypothesis testing. This is heavily based on John Kruschke's excellent book: https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/

'Bayes_Modelling_Intro' focuses more on the cogneuro part of Bayes.

'BSc_Bayes_ParamEstimation' contains some work on Bayesian vs. frequentist parameter estimation in the context of an undergrad thesis in mathematics (code for simulations to follow).
